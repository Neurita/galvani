Named after the Luigi Aloisio Galvani (1737 – 1798) was an Italian physician, physicist and philosopher. He discovered that the muscles of dead frogs legs twitched when struck by an electrical spark.This was one of the first forays into the study of bioelectricity, a field that still studies the electrical patterns and signals of the nervous system. The beginning of Galvani's experiments with bioelectricity has a popular legend which says that Galvani was slowly skinning a frog at a table where he had been conducting experiments with static electricity by rubbing frog skin. The observation made Galvani the first investigator to appreciate the relationship between electricity and animation — or life.
